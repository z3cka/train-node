          <small>What is node.js?</small>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## From Nodejs.org

            <blockquote>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

            # WAT?
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            <blockquote>
              Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime [...]
            </blockquote>

            * Chrome's JavaScript runtime is called V8, it's one of the reasons
              Chrome is considered so fast.
            * node.js leverages V8's speed on the server!
          </section>

            <blockquote>
              [...] easily building fast, scalable network applications.
            </blockquote>

            * Node wants to act as a message passer (more on this later).

            <blockquote>
              Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model [...]
            </blockquote>

            * Only one thing gets executed at a time, but libraries allow I/O
              or other intensive tasks to be executed asynchronously so the
              script doesn't need to wait for them to finish.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### What Makes it
            ### *Fast and Scaleable?*

            * V8 Engine

            * Asynchronous libraries

            * Event Driven.

            # PHP is slow.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## What do you mean by slow?
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## We actually mean bad at handling concurency.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### Why is PHP/Drupal bad at handling concurency?

            * Big memory foot print.
              * If you need to load 100Meg of Code to deliver 4 lines of JSON. . .
            * Everything happens in order.
              * You 100ms database call will hold up the execution of the enire process.
              * Your next 100ms call will do the same, etc.
              * Only after all the database calls have completed can we return the 4 lines of JSON.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## In node:

            ## Imagine a King with servants

            * Every morning the servants line up.
            * One at a time they come into his throne room.
            * They report on what they've done.
            * Sometimes the king gives them more to do.
            * Always one at a time, so the king can focus.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Code Please.

            <pre><code class="javascript">
              var fs = require('fs')
                , sys = require('sys');

              fs.readFile('treasure-chamber-report.txt', function readFile(report) {
                sys.puts("oh, look at all my money: "+report);
              });

              fs.writeFile('letter-to-princess.txt', '...', function writeFile() {
                sys.puts("can't wait to hear back from her!");
              });
            </code></pre>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### Explain the Code Please.

            * Code gives node 2 things to do.
            * Each callback gets fired one at a time
            * Until one callback is fired all others wait in line
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### However

            * We don't need to wait for the file being read, to write the file.
            * Both System IO calls are started independently.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### Don't need to wait for one to finish before the next starts!
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Why not write non-blocking/event-driven PHP

          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## There are event driven Async PHP frameworks.

            For example: [PRADOTM](http://www.photon-project.com/)
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Libraries.

            * PHP libraries are primarily blocking and not event driven.
            * Node.js libraries are almost all non-blocking and event driven.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### What is it node.js good for

            * Rapid prototyping
            * Bursty load
            * API glue
            * Queue-ish stuff
            * "Real-time" applications
              * Easy example: chat
            * **Message passing!**
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### What is it node.js NOT good for

            * General purpose web server
            * (Large) static assets
            * Complex systems (business logic)
            * Lots of processing - use C or PHP
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### What We've used it for

            * [RSS Hub](https://github.com/elliotttf/PubHub)
            * [Interactive game](http://drupalpoetry.com)
            * Realtime video commenting
            * [IRC Bot](http://hubot.github.com/)
            * [Parsing HTML](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom)
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### What about the community?

            * Lots of Frameworks
            * Package manager that kicks butt
              * Over 16k packages
            * Very fast moving project
              * 63 Releases in the last year and half
            * Welcoming community
            * Used by big companies
            * Plays well with others
            * Drupal module

          <small>Your environment</small>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Connecting to the server

            * SSH into the server from your local machine
              <pre><code class="no-highlight">
                $ ssh YOU@nodejs.4kclass.com
              </code></pre>
            * Pro-tip: You may want to keep two terminal sessions open to the server so
              you can edit files while running a node process or edit two files
              at once in different windows.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Editing files

            * Use your preferred editor on server
              (we like vim but won't judge if you use emacs -- but we can't help you either).
            * If you want to edit files locally, SFTP with the credentials you were provided
              <pre><code class="no-highlight">
                $ sftp YOU@nodejs.4kclass.com
              </code></pre>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## File structure

            * All course code is located in
              <pre><code class="no-highlight">~/train-node</code></pre>
            * Familiarize yourself with the files and directories here,
              you'll be spending most of your time in the following directories:
              <pre><code class="no-highlight">
                ~/train-node/js101
                ~/train-node/exercises/drupal
                ~/train-node/exercises/server
              </code></pre>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Commands you'll be using

            * ```cp [src] [dst]``` - to copy a file
            * ```mv [src] [dst]``` - to move or rename a file
            * ```rm [file]``` - to delete a file
            * ```node [file]``` - to start a node process (or just ```node``` to
              use the node REPL shell).
            * ```CTRL+C``` - to stop a node process that does not automatically exit.

          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Environment Variables

            * A unique port has been assigned to each of you, it's in the
              ```~/port-xxxxx``` file in your home directory. You'll need
              this when we start a node server.
            * The ```~/config.json``` file in your home directory can be used to
              inject settings in your node code (more on that later).
          </section>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## ```console.log()```

          Same debugging tool you use in the browser.

          * Create your first app!
          * Make an app.js file in the _/console.log_ folder.
          * Add one line. . .

          <pre><code class="javascript">
            console.log('Mathamatical!');
          </code></pre>

          Now run it

          <pre><code class="no-highlight">
            $ node app
          </code></pre>

          <section data-markdown>
            ## Where does ```require()``` look for files?

            * Core libraries
            * modules in the node_modules directory
            * locally defined modules _if the module is prefixed with a path_
              * Paths can be absolute, but this is highly discouraged, use the relative paths or package your own module.

            You might need it, we haven't.

            * Sometimes simplifies code flow.
            * Useful if you _need_ to stop code from executing until the operation is completed.

            <pre><code class="javascript">
              var start = Date.now();

              setTimeout(function timeout1() {
                console.log('We started execution ' + (Date.now() - start) + 'ms ago.');

                for (var x = 0; x < 3999999999; x++) {}

                console.log('Done with timeout1().');
              }, 1000);

              setTimeout(function timeout2() {
                console.log('We started execution ' + (Date.now() - start) + 'ms ago.');
                console.log('Done with timeout2().');
              }, 2000);
            </code></pre>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Keep it simple.

            Don't put complicated logic in the main event thread.

            * Long sorts/searches.
            * Long Math (fibbonacci sequence).
            * Processing lots of raw data.

            * Hand off to other program and listen for event.
            * Write C
            * Use a queue

            * A web application framework for node.js
            * Provides:
              * Static asset handling
              * Dynamic router

          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### Getting started

            * Use the ```express``` command to set up some scaffolding for a new application:
            <pre><code class="no-highlight">
              $ cd ~/train-node/exercies

            </code></pre>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### Getting started (cont)

            * We're going to make a few changes to support the application we're going to build:
              1. Copy the config.js file and client directory from your home directory to the example dirctory:
                <pre><code class="no-highlight">
                  $ cp ~/config.json ~/train-node/exercises/myserver/config.js
                </code></pre>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Edit app.js

            Include the config we copied by adding it after the where path is required. Don't forget to remove the ";" after require('path').

            <pre><code class="diff">
-  , path = require('path');
+  , path = require('path')
+  , config = require('./config');
            </code></pre>

            Use the port number from the config file.

            <pre><code class="diff">
-  app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000);
+  app.set('port', config.port);

            2. We'll put the code that talks to node in a node_view hook.
            3. Hint: we'll use drupal\_json\_encode() and drupal\_http\_request()
            4. Be sure to handle errors.

            ### Example Drupal Module code.
            <pre><code class="php">
              $data = array('title' => $node->title);
              $data = drupal_json_encode($data);
              $uri = variable_get('ping_nodejs_uri','http://localhost:3000/ping');

              $options = array();
              $options['headers'] = array('Content-Type' => 'application/json');
              $options['method'] = 'POST';
              $options['data'] = $data;
              $response = drupal_http_request($uri, $options);

              if ($response->code != 200) {
                drupal_set_message("Got an error: " . $response->error, 'error');
              }
              else {
                drupal_set_message('Successfully contacted node server. Response was: ' . $response->data);

            ## Install and Configure Services module.

            1. It's already there, just enable it.
            2. go to admin/structure/services
            3. configure a rest server with endpoint "rest".
            4. configure the rest server with the node resource.

            <blockquote>
              Socket.IO aims to make realtime apps possible in every browser and mobile device, blurring the differences between the different transport mechanisms. It's care-free realtime 100% in JavaScript.

               your application.
            1. Save messages in memory.
            1. Serve saved stories and messages to clients when they (re)connect.
            1. Fetch custom stories from RSS feeds, third party APIs, or your Drupal site!

            ### Bonus challenges, cont

            1. Fetch custom images and save them in memory.
            1. Serve custom images to clients when they (re)connect.
            1. Store the stories, messages, and images in either MySQL or MongoDB.
               Use this list to avoid creating duplicate content in case the feed
               re-sends an item or you need to restart your node server.

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Overview

            * One of the easiest places to see asynchronous programming:
              1. Application makes call to database and immediately returns to the event loop.
              1. Later, database calls back with results.
            * For the more advanced examples in this class you'll be given the opportunity to work with a database, either MySQL or MongoDB.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### MySQL

            * [http://www.mysql.com/](http://www.mysql.com/)
            * Relational database system
            * If you're a Drupal developer you're probably pretty familiar with it, but the libraries we'll be using to interact with it aren't as abstracted as DBTNG.
             * i.e. you'll have to write actual SQL queries ಠ_ಠ
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### Node.js and MySQL

            * We'll be using the [node-mysql](https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql) library.
            * ```$ npm install mysql@2.0.0-alpha3```
            <pre><code class="javascript">
              var mysql = require('mysql');
              var conn = mysql.createConnection({
                host: 'localhost',
                user: 'you',
                password: 'unsafe'
              });
              conn.connect();

              conn.query('SELECT "Hello world" AS message', function selectResult(err, rows, fields) {
                if (err) {
                  throw err;
                }

                console.log(rows[0].message);
              });
              conn.end();

            ### MongoDB

            * [http://www.mongodb.org/](http://www.mongodb.org/)
            * Schemaless document store
            * Documents are stored as BSON which is very similar to JSON and therefore extremely convenient to work with in node.js!
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### MongoDB Examples

            * There's not a real query language in the same sense as MySQL and since the database is schemaless you can throw whatever you like at it:

              ```$ mongo```
            <pre><code class="javascript">
              db.test.insert({
                title: 'test',
                message: 'Hello world'
              });
              db.test.find({ title: 'test' }).pretty();
              db.test.update(
                { title: 'test' },
                { $set: { message: 'Yo dawg' } }
              );
              db.test.find({ title: 'test' }).pretty();
            </code></pre>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### Sub documents

            * One of the most useful parts of MongoDB is the ability to store "sub documents" or objects within a primary document:

            <pre><code class="javascript">
              db.test.update(
                { title: 'test'},
                { $set: {
                  speaker: {
                    name: 'Elliott Foster',
                    occupation: 'Hipster Technologist',
                    interests: [
                      'JavaScript',
                      'beer',
                      'bicycles'
                    ]
                  }
                } }
              );
              db.test.find({ 'speaker.name': 'Elliott Foster' }).pretty();
            </code></pre>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Node.js and MongoDB

            * We'll be using the [mongode](https://github.com/milewise/mongode) library to interact with MongoDB
            <pre><code class="javascript">
              var mongode = require('mongode');
              var test = mongode.connect('mongo://127.0.0.1/test');
              var collection = test.collection('test');
              var doc = { title: 'test2', message: 'node and mongo, yay!' };
              collection.insert(doc, {safe:true}, function insertResult(err, objects) {
                if (err) {
                  console.error(err.message);
                  process.exit(1);
                }
                collection.findOne({ title: 'test2' }, function findOneResult(err, document) {
                  if (err) {
                    console.error(err.message);
                    process.exit(1);
                  }
                  console.log(document.message);
